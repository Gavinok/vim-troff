This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

INTRODUCTION 									*troff-introduction* *troff*

Whenever you edit a file with the extension .ms,.mom,.me,.mm,.tr,.troff,.tmac,
this plugin will be automatically activated.

NAVIGATION										*troff-navigation*

Navigating between macro files and troff files can often be tricky so be sure
to add your macro directory to your |path|. By default
/usr/share/groff/current/tmac is appended to |path| but you can set your own
macro directory 

												*g:troff-macro-dir*

Comma separated list of directories used for storing macros defaults to
/usr/share/groff/current/tmac if it exists.
>
	let g:troff_macro_dir=/usr/share/groff/current/tmac
<
|:find| can then locate a macro file for you.

For groff users you can also add your global macros by setting
|g:groff_install_prefix|

    	                                        *g:troff-include*

Settings for both |include| and |define| have been set for use with .so and
.mso so you can use |include-search| and |definition-search| to jump to
definitions with [<C-D> use completion with <C-X><C-D> or <C-X><C-I> |djump|
and much more.

COMPLETION										*troff-completion*

vim-troff comes with an |omnifunc| for somewhat intelligent completion. It
supports eqn, tbl, and pic, groff requests, and groff glyphs. In addition the
omnifunc will try to determine the current macros for additional completion.
by default the omnifunc is enabled. You can activate this completions with
<C-X><C-O> in insert mode.

SYNTAX	                                       *troff-syntax*

vim-troff adds multiple additions to the syntax such as spell checking and
syntax folding for preprocessor sections.

NOTE: currently vim-troff assumes that your groff implementation allows for
more then 2 character macros and commands.

	                                           *troff-eqn-conceal*
vim-troff adds concealing similar to how |tex-conceal| works. To disable
eqn concealing set
>
    let g:groff_greek  = 0
    let g:groff_math   = 0
    let g:groff_subsup = 0

COMPATIBILITY	                               *troff-compatibly*

Currently vim-troff is focused on supporting groff and will slowly add
compatibility for alternative troff implementations.

                                                *troff-plugin-compatibility*
                                                *troff-matchit*
Additional settings are added to |matchit| to add support for jumping between
certain macros and the start and end of a preprocessor. 

                                                *troff-surround*
vim-troff also adds support for tpope's surround plugin using E for eqn, T for
tbl, P for pic, f for font, and \ as \[].
